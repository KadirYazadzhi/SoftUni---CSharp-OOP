# 📘 C# OOP - February 2025

Welcome to the **C# OOP** course repository! Here, you'll find my solutions to exercises, challenges, and workshops from SoftUni's **C# OOP** course. Let's explore object-oriented programming together! 🚀

## 🌟 Course Overview

The **C# OOP** course teaches students the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, working with **classes and objects**, object-oriented modeling, and building class hierarchies. The course covers the **four fundamental OOP principles**: **abstraction** (interfaces and abstract classes), **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**. You'll also learn **design patterns** (creational, structural, and behavioral patterns), **SOLID** principles for software design, **debugging techniques**, and **unit testing** with **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.

This repository contains solutions, explanations, and resources for mastering these concepts.
